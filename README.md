# Slack Groupchat Model
My own version of a clone of the slack groupchat application.
BUILT WITH
Ruby on Rails, JQUERY, JSON, REACT, HTML, CSS
The application has the ability to create an account, add rooms and chat with other users with a 3 second auto refresh for any new updates. The groupchat was built with REACT.js
